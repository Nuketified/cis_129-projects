# This program calculates and stores a running total of bottles collected over 7 days, then asks the user if they want to input data for another week, then prints the total number of bottles collected and the amount paid out for the week.

# Lab 5 The Bottle Return Program

# Step 1: Declare variables below

total_bottles = 0  
counter = 1 # this variable will control the loop 
today_bottles = 0 # this variable will store the nummber of bottles returned on a day 
total_payout = 0 # this variable will store the calculated value of totalBottles times .10 
# call to get_total_bottles (get_total = get_total_bottles())
# call to get_today_bottles (get_today = get_today_bottles())
