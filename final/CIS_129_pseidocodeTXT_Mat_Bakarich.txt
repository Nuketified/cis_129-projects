    #Allow tournament organizer to configure and save table layout in the existing graphical user interface.
        
        # in the create event menu, create a check-box labelled "Show table locations in CompanionApp?"
            
        # While this box is checked, display two additional options with a bullet point for selection:
                # "Use Saved Layout"
                    When this is selected, check to see if any table layouts have been saved.
                        If yes, display the saved layouts and allow the user to use the interface to select one for the event. 
                        If no, display, "No Saved Layouts found."
                
                # "Create New Layout"
                    When this is selected, open a new browser tab with:    
                        -a full screen visual representation of the table layout for the venue, with no tables represented.
                        -an interactable visual interface at the bottom of the screen.
                            This should include:
                                -table to manually drag and drop to create new tables
                                -trash icon
                                -save icon
                                -compass indicator pointing North, include buttons to rotate compass orientation by 90 degrees clockwise or 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
                                -box with appropriately labelled fields for entering table/row values 
                    -Lock the user to this window until it is closed.

                # If the user selects the other option, close any windows displayed by the other button selection.


        
        
            # The user will be able to enter values in the following fields: "total number of tables:", "total number of rows" "tables per row"
            # If the user inputs 2 of the 3 values the program will use basic arithmetic to calculate the basic layout and display the tables.
                Total number of tables = Total number of rows * tables per row
                    Ignore non-integers inputs.

            # This step may be repeated by changing the values in the boxes. The map displayed will update accordingly and overwrite the previous entries.

            # Then the user will be able to manually drag and drop tables to adjust or drag them to a trash can icon to delete them, 
            
            
        
                
            # the user can then save the layout using a save button displayed at the bottom.
                -When the user clicks the save button:
                    -Prompt the user with a pop-up window displaying 2 numbering examples displayed as images on highlightable buttons. 
                        Only the most recently clicked one is highlighted.
                        # examples: 1  2  3  4    1  2  3  4
                                    5  6  7  8    8  7  6  5
                                    9 10 11 12    9 10 11 12 


                    -Display a check box labelled "Reverse table numbers?"
                        -While checked, display the same images but instead of numbering from the initial table, start numbering from the final table and work backwards.
                        -Update the buttons above so the numbers match when this box is checked or unchecked.
                    The user will then click a button labelled "Save" or a button labelled "Cancel"
                        
                        When the "Save" button is clicked:  
                           
                            -check for the default save folder location locally.
                                -If found, save to that location.
                                -If not found, create it. Then save to that location.
                                -close this window and return to the "Create Event" menu where the user will finish creating the event as normal.
                        
                        When the "Cancel" button is clicked:
                            
                                -close this window and return to the previous one where the user can continue editing the table layout.

                    
                    
                    
                        


               Once saved, return the user to the original tab. Close this tab.

            # the user then finishes creating the event as usual.                    
 
 
 
 
 Companion App
    # If the feature is enabled in the EventLink software, players registered for an event in the Companion App will be able to view a third tab when pairings are displayed every round.
        # The first two options, “Pairings” and “Standings” already exist in the Companion App. Add a third tab to this interface.
        # The first option is the "Pairings" with player name and table number. 
        # The second option is currently "Standings" that displays the standings after the last completed round of the event.
        # The third option will be "Table." and will take the user to a screen displaying the seating layout to the player and highlighting the location of their table.
            # Use the data from pairings to get opponent name and table number and create a text object displaying that information on top of the map.
                # Example: "Your match is at table 24 against Richard G."
